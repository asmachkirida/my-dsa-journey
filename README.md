# DSA-Java-Solutions

Hi, I'm Asma! Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning journey. This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges from platforms like LeetCode, organized by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**. My goal is to continuously improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of algorithms and data structures using **Java**.

## Repository Structure

The problems are categorized by difficulty for easy navigation:

- **Easy**: Foundational problems covering basic algorithms and data structures.
- **Medium**: Intermediate problems that build on fundamental concepts.
- **Hard**: Advanced problems that require complex problem-solving strategies.

Each problem folder contains:
- A **Java solution** with well-commented code.
- **Problem description** and the link to the original problem on LeetCode.
- **Approach and solution breakdown** with time and space complexity analysis.

## Goals
- Solve at least one problem daily.
- Continuously learn new algorithms and apply them.
- Improve time complexity and space optimization skills.
- Keep track of my progress and share it through this repository.

## How to Use This Repo
1. Browse the **Easy**, **Medium**, or **Hard** directories for specific problems.
2. Check out the code for each solution and read the comments to understand the approach.
3. Feel free to fork this repo, try the problems yourself, or suggest improvements.
